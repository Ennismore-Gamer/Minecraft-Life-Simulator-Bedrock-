Features include:
1. Age Progression
Players will age over time.
Every 10 seconds (200 ticks), the player's age will increase by 1 year.
The player receives a message every time their age increases (e.g., "You are now X years old!").
2. Marriage System
Players can toggle their marital status with other players.
Marriage:
If a player marries another player, a message will confirm the marriage (e.g., "You are now married to [partner name]").
Players can marry by using the toggleMarriage(player, partnerName) function.
Divorce:
If a player is already married, using the same function will result in a divorce (e.g., "You are now divorced.").
The marital status will reset, and the player will no longer be married to anyone.
3. Health Decline Over Time
Player health decreases by 1 every 10 seconds (200 ticks).
A player's health will be displayed in the chat every time it decreases (e.g., "Your health is now: [health amount]").
Health starts at 100 by default, but it will decrease as time passes.
If the player's health reaches 0, they are effectively "unwell" or "dead" (you could further expand the system to implement consequences for having 0 health).
4. Player Alive Check
Alive Status: The script keeps track of the playerâ€™s health and determines whether they are "alive" based on the health value.
Health below 1 means the player would be considered "dead" (though additional actions could be added, like respawning or a death event).
5. Player Join Event
When a player joins the world, their data is initialized.
Age: The player starts with an age of 0.
Marriage Status: The player starts with no marriage (null).
Health: The player starts with 100 health points.
This initialization ensures each player starts with a fresh life simulation state when joining the game.
6. Automatic Updates (via Ticks)
The tick event updates players every 10 seconds.
This updates both age and health over time (age increases, and health decreases).
The updates occur continuously while the world is running, making the life simulation dynamic.
7. Interaction via Commands (Optional)
You could extend this system by creating custom commands to trigger specific actions (like marriage, aging, or health checks) directly from the in-game chat.
For example, players might use /marry [playerName] to marry another player, or /age to manually increment their age.
8. Customizable Time Intervals
The system uses a time-based approach (every 200 ticks), which can be customized to fit your needs. You could adjust how often the age progresses or health decreases.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT:
Manifest File: Ensure you have the correct manifest.json file in your behavior pack to link the script.
Add the Behavior Pack: Add the script as a behavior pack in your Minecraft Bedrock world.
Enable Experimental Gameplay: Enable Experimental Gameplay to allow custom scripts.

NOTE -- this has not been tested. I recommend making a backup of Minecraft.
